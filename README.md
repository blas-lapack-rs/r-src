# r-blas-lapack-src

A source of [BLAS] and [LAPACK] via R. Note that only double precision
routines are provided by R. The build script for this particilar crate
owes a lot to [libR-sys](https://github.com/extendr/libR-sys) of the
[extendr](https://github.com/extendr) project, with sections lifted
from there, in addition to new code.
